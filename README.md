This application will create a source of information for students and contribute to have a better knowledge of football besides by making them to follow their development efficiently. Students will be selected assigned to some teachers and their football school calendar will be determined by them, especially when an individual student have special needs (for example, extra trainings for running). There will be skill sets and measurements to be determined by the teachers. Teachers will evaluate the performance of each student and the long run performance analysis of each student will be introduced to them. Students will be offered to events frequently which will be organized by teachers. The announcements also will be
made through the system. 
The frontend of TFF Foundation for Children was built with React.js and the backend was built with Javascript, express.js and MongoDB.
